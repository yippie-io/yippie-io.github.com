[iUPB Timetable](http://www.i-upb.de/timetable) iCal Feed
==================
This is not a web-api, but rather a convenience method for you to get your timetable data out of iUPB and in your calendar, mobile phone, ...

Usage
=====
  
After you log in at our site and click the timetable feature, scroll to the very bottom and click or copy the link that says 'Download to my device'.    
![Screenshot of download button](images/ical-download-screenshot.jpg)

This includes a personalised URL to all your timetable entries in the [iCalendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) format.    
As this URL is private and only for you, do not share it.

You can open the URL in any compatible calendar application, such as Microsoft Outlook including outlook.com, Apple iCal including iOS devices and the iCloud, Google Calender, Lotus Notes and more.     
Your calendar application will from now on load updates from iUPB you make to your calendar.    
The URL stays the same regardless of the current semester.

More
===============

We consider this experimental, as currently we do not have a system to properly authenticate an user of yours with our app. The iCal feed itself works pretty well, we have many subscribers and tried hard to make all different clients happy.
