iUPB Navigator API
==================
The navigator API enables you to get information for a specific major at the University of Paderborn targeted for students. At the moment, most of the important contact persons for a student are returned (gathered from the ZSB).
  
The API-endpoint is [**navigator.api.i-upb.de**](http://navigator.api.i-upb.de). At the root of the domain, you also find some [documentation](http://navigator.api.i-upb.de).

The API supports JSONP.
  
As this data is gathered from public databases of the University of Paderborn and we built this feature in cooperation with the [ZSB](http://zsb.upb.de), we consider this as a **public** API.
