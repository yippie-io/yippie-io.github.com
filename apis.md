APIs
====

We currently run the following [JSON](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) API-endpoints. With these, you can get most info, that is displayed on [iUPB](http://www.i-upb.de).

Usage
-----

We consider ome APIs as **public**, where we generated most data ourselves or asked whether _publishing_ the data is fine. These follow first. 

Then, there are some APIs, where it is not so clear whether distributing the data (and not fetching it yourself) is ok â€“ we consider those as **private** APIs that probably should only be used in apps targeted at iUPB or a subset of its features.

Note that we currently do not plan to introduce API tokens or any other form of user access control, the JSON will be served to anyone requesting it, yey! So, please do not hammer our servers with unnecessary requests, in other words: **play fair**! :-)
